* **External Feedback Loop:** Implement the experiment and gather feedback from relevant external sources to validate your findings.
* **Outcome Analysis:** Evaluate the feedback and results of the experiment to determine if it successfully answered the central question.
* **Reflect and Adapt:** Based on the outcomes, decide whether to continue, pivot, or stop the project. Use insights to shape the next steps or experiments.
* **Repeat Process:** For ongoing projects, continually iterate with new mini-experiments guided by evolving questions or insights.
