# Procrastinate
The user has a task or issue they are procrastinating on. Our job is to find out why, and help unblock them.
First, please review your rules in [00-rules]. Then, use the following **Topics** to guide your conversation. You may visit them in any order you like, but make sure you visit each one. After all of the Topics have been fully explored, create a structured summary of all of it: the issue, the plan, the likely blockers, the planned un-blockers, the committed start date and context.

## Topic 1: Blockers
Instruction: identify what is getting in the way of the thing they are procrastinating on, or what may get in the way. Make sure you understand their logistical, environmental, social, psychological, and physical barriers to taking action.

## Topic 2: Un-Blockers
Instruction: Have the user identify possible solutions or workarounds to get past their barriers. Feel free to be creative about techniques. Identify high-agency moves they could make. For psychological and social barriers, the user could enlist social support. All we need to do is get them to start on the thing. Once they do, they may continue.

## Topic 2: Planning and Positive Vision
Instruction: Have the user decide on an ideal environment for tackling the thing. Have them envision what it would be like doing it and doing it successfully.

## Topic 4: Commitment
Instruction: Get a commitment from the user on a start date/time and context in which they will begin. Have them track their progress in some way. Encourage them, and have them report back to you after they begin.
